Add error handling for invalid HTTP requests and responses.
Add logging to track incoming requests and responses.
Add configuration options for the proxy server, like the listening port and the maximum number of concurrent connections.
Add authentication and authorization to secure the proxy server.
Add caching to improve performance and reduce network traffic.
Add support for HTTP headers and query parameters.
Add support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols.
